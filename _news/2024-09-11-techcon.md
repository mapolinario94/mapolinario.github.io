I had a fantastic time attending [SRC's TECHCON 2024](https://www.src.org/newsroom/article/2024/1076/){:target="\_blank} in Austin, TX! I had the opportunity to present my research on "S-TLLR: STDP-inspired Temporal Local Learning Rule for Spiking Neural Networks", and to connect with fellow PhD students and industry professionals. It was inspiring to learn about the exciting projects happening in the semiconductor and AI fields. The future looks bright, and I'm excited to see what's next!

A big thank you to Center for the Co-Design of Cognitive Systems and the Nanoelectronics Research Laboratory (NRL) at Purdue University for their support, and to Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) for the invitation and for organizing such a wonderful event.
