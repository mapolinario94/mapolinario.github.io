I recently had the opportunity to attend the [Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/telluride-2024/home?authuser=0){:target="\_blank}, a three-week workshop held in Telluride, Colorado. It was an experience I will never forget. The workshop perfectly blended intellectual stimulation with natural beauty, providing a unique environment to learn, collaborate, and explore.

During the workshop, I had the privilege of presenting a talk with Kathryn Simone on "Neuromodulation in Nature and Machines", which was also the focus of the project I was involved in. The project explored various aspects of neuromodulation, including its applications for synaptic plasticity in online learning settings and its potential for switching between different behaviors in dynamical systems. The discussions and insights gained were invaluable, and I look forward to continuing this work and collaborating with everyone involved. I loved having the opportunity to meet and connect with brilliant minds from various fields. I will cherish forever all the conversations, collaborations, and friendships formed.

Beyond the intellectual engagement, the natural surroundings of Telluride added a special dimension to the experience. The breathtaking hikes and stunning scenery were simply awesome, making it hard to leave. Participating in the Fourth of July parade was incredibly fun, but my favorite social event was the "Talent Show of Useless Talents", which was indeed the funniest activity.

I am incredibly grateful for this experience and already look forward to future adventures and collaborations with the amazing people I met. It is an honor to be part of this incredible community.
