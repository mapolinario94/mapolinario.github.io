I'm honored to announce that I've been awarded the NSF AccelNet NeuroPAC Fellowship to support my research project titled "Efficient On-Device Learning: Hardware-Software Co-Design of a Digital Neural Accelerator Utilizing Local Learning Rules", a collaborative effort between Purdue University and Delft University of Technology.

As part of this project, I've joined the Cognitive Sensor Nodes and Systems (CogSys) lab at TU Delft as a visiting PhD student for Fall 2024, where I will focus on the co-design of a digital hardware accelerator with on-device learning capabilities based on local learning rules. I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with Prof. Charlotte Frenkel and her group. I look forward to learning from their approach to neuromorphic systems and exploring the synergies between neuroscience, machine learning, and hardware design.

A heartfelt thank you to Prof. Charlotte Frenkel and my advisor Prof. Kaushik Roy for their invaluable support and mentorship, and to the NeuroPAC organization for their generous support in making this project possible.

Looking forward to contributing to the advancement of the neuromorphic field and sharing updates on the work ahead!
