I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, under the guidance of Professor Kaushik Roy in the [Nanoelectronics Research Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/NRL){:target="\_blank"}. I earned my B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering from the National University of Engineering (UNI), Peru, in 2017. Over the years, I have gathered valuable experience, including a research internship at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) and a Research Assistant role at the Signal and Image Processing Lab at INICTEL-UNI, Peru. In 2020, I was honored to receive the fully-funded 'Beca Presidente de la Republica' graduate scholarship from the Peruvian Government (PRONABEC), and in 2023, I pursued a research internship at Kilby Labs, Texas Instruments.

My research focus revolves around hardware/software co-design for brain-inspired computing. I am passionate about leveraging insights from biological mechanisms to develop more efficient artificial intelligence models.
